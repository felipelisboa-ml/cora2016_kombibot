## Cora 2016 - PID Controller for Line Follower ##

Back in 2016, me and my friends, Gabriel and Vitor, won the 3rd annual competition of autonomous robots, which took place in the Engineering School of UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The challenge was to develop, from scratch, a line-follower robot, which had to be both fast and precise. During our development process, we took physical aspects into consideration, making it as similar as we could to F1 cars (seriously). We used an Arduino board (don't remember which one exactly), and the software running in it is a PID controller with meticulously fine-tuned parameters (i.e., through trial-and-error). Definitely an unforgettable moment in our young engineering careers.
